To create Views just run node index.js and enter the model name. This will create a folder /<model-name> and inside it the following react views:

* Edit
* Index
* New
* Show

Each of these files will be customized as well. 

To use this generator from any folder install it globally:
`npm install -g` 

To generate a new project just go to the desired folder destination and type:
`gview`
