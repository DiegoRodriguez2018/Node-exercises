To create Views just run node index.js and enter the model name. This will create a folder /<model-name> and inside it the following react views:

* Edit
* Index
* New
* Show

Development goals:
1. modify the files so it replaces modelName placeholder to the model name entered by the user. 
2. modify the generator so create /Views/ folder if it doesnt exist yet allowing the user to run the command from the project root folder.
